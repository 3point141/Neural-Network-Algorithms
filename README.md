# Neural-Network-Algorithms
Algorithms of Neural Networks written in MATLAB 

# hebbian.m 
The code takes the input vectors, weights, learning constant and plots the updated weights at each stage

# net.m
The code multiplies two matrices

# BAM_network.m
This matlab code trains the weights for Bi-directional Associative Memory Network for english alphabects when made in a matrix of 5x3 

# max_net.m
Specific example of neural net based on competition. It can be used as a subnet to pick the node whose input is the largest.

# max_hat.m
This matlab codes takes n number of input neurons with the following parameters:
-> radius of region of interconnections
-> radius of region with positive interconnections
-> constant c1
-> constant c2 
-> external signal. 
The code performs the mexican hat algorithm on these input neurons for and desired number of times.
